## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **One giant commit**: Breaking the project into small, logical commits is essential.
2. **Unclear commit messages**: Messages like "fix" or "update" don't help reviewers understand changes.
3. **Working directly on main**: Always use feature branches.
4. **Forgetting to pull**: Always pull latest changes before starting work.
5. **Committing sensitive data**: Never commit API keys or passwords (use .env files).
6. **Poor PR descriptions**: Help reviewers understand what you changed and why.

## Tips for Success

- Start early and commit often
- Test your code before committing
- Write clear commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Review your own PR before submitting
- Ask questions if you're unsure about Git workflows
